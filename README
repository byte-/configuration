# Configuration repo

This is a repository for various dotfiles and configuration files that are used on my Linux system(s). It mirrors the format of my home (~) directory. Some of the programs that will make use of these configuration files have their defaults set to another configuration file. To make the files as orderly as possible, I alias several programs with arguments corresponding to me usual configruation directory.

For example, in my aliases (.config/zsh/aliases) I have a section for program defaults, which forces programs like weechat to use a configuration directory inside ~/.config, rather than ~/.weechat.

Obviously take care of copying configuration files without looking them over for conflicts or compatibility issues.
